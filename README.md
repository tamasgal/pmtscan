# PMTScan
This tiny app makes then scan procedure of the KM3NeT photomultipliers a bit easier, however, as it turned out you can select two columns in Excel, turn on TAB post-action on the scanner and it will jump to the correct cell after each scan.

You need to install Angular.js and Bootstrap e.g. via npm (execute it in the root folder of the project):

    npm install bootstrap
    npm install angular

â€¦and then open index.html in your browser.
